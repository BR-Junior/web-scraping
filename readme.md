## Getting Started

You can clone the repository or access it through the link: [Replit Repository](https://replit.com/@BianorRamos/web-scraping)

### Prerequisites

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)


## Running

Run project

```bash

This code only works if the issue has a label.
